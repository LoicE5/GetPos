# GetPos script

## Introduction

This simple script prints the canvas position of your cursor on the screen.
I recommend you to click once on the icon of the script, then move your cursor to wherever you like without clicking anywhere, the pressing the return key to trigger the script and print the mouse position.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you will need any version of Python installed on your computer.

**[Install python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**

You will also need the **pynput** library, that can be installed using **PIP**.

**[Install PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)**

Then run this code snipped in any terminal :

<code>pip install pynput</code>

## Second monitor

It is very useful to place the explorer's window on a secondary monitor, in order to trigger the *GetPos.py file* when pressing enter without having to deal with **Alt + Tab** or other annoying manipulations.
